# Hatsa code assignment
Hello! To get a feeling for your current skills regarding our frontend stack, you've been requested to do this assignment. If you came across this repository by chance, please see [the vacancy](https://hatsa.com/jobs/sr-frontend-engineer) first.

The assignment should take no longer than 1-2 hours to complete. Try to complete everything within this time, getting it to work first, then make it better if you have some time left.

## Getting started
1. Create a private repository on GitHub
2. Clone this repository locally in the regular way
3. Change the `origin` remote url to your private repository and push
4. Add `florisvink` and `bvangraafeiland` as collaborators to your repository
5. Install dependencies using `yarn`

The application can then be started with `yarn dev`. This starts the NextJS development server on http://localhost:3000.

## The assignments
The assignments can be done in any order you like, but try to complete all of them. Use TypeScript features wherever applicable to indicate how experienced you are with it.

For each assignment, create a separate branch and pull request. In the pull request, write a short summary of how and why you've done things, and how long it took to solve. In case you haven't completed everything, try to describe how you would solve the problem if you had more time.

### API requests
In `/search`, you'll find the boilerplate for a simple version of our product search. A function to fetch the results is provided, as well as a basic way to display the results. Implement two versions of this search:
- Client side - fetch the data as the page is rendered in the browser
- Server side - fetch the data before

You can copy the provided file to implement both versions. Feel free to install any packages that you think help solve the problem.

**Bonus**: improve the styling of the results list.

### Performance issues
On `/profile` you can find a basic profile form. It seems to be a little slow to respond to input!

Find out why this is the case and refactor the code to improve the responsiveness. For this you can edit the `profile.tsx` and `FormInput.tsx` files, but you may not remove the `wait(50)` statement which slows the rendering of the input field.

Explain how you found the issue and what you did to resolve it (hint: `useMemo` or `React.memo` are not necessary here!).

### Button component
In `components/Button.tsx` you'll find a starting point for a button component. Implement the design of the button found [here](https://www.sketch.com/s/d9aab920-a4c4-40fc-bbb5-894053afd607). Use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling - it has been set up in the project already.

The component should receive props to allow for different variants:
- Color - there are two colors to choose from at this time, but make it so that new colors could be added easily
- Size
- Regular (with background color) or outline (white background with a colored border)
- An optional icon preceding the button text (the icon can be downloaded under "Download Assets" at the bottom right of the Sketch page)

The colors should change based on the button state (default, hover and active). To test this component, you can create a new page, or refer to the bonus objective.

**Bonus**: create stories for the button component. [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) has been set up in the project already. Unfortunately, due to incompatible packages, the dev server of Storybook doesn't work. To run the production version, first run `yarn build-storybook` and then `yarn start-storybook` to have it available on http://localhost:8080.
